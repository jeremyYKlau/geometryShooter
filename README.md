# geometryShooter
Built off of SebLague game with my own changes

IMPORTANT NOTE
If you want just the executable you can just take the file called executable which has the executable
and the game data which is all it should need.

CONCEPT
I am bad at 3D modeling as I never took any courses in blender or maya so I'm self taught. Not wanting
to spend all my time doing modeling I instead decided to make a game centering around simple shapes
and with following SebLague's tutorial, after finishing I made some changes and added new enemies 
with gameplay features. This is my own work other then the pieces of code and is open to everyone else to use
called Geometry Shooter.
